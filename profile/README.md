# Welcome to ProbeLab ðŸ‘‹

The Protocol Measurement, Benchmarking & Optimization Team

## About Us

[ProbeLab](https://probelab.io) is on a mission to measure the performance of Web3.0 network protocols, benchmark protocols against target performance milestones, and propose improvements to their core design principles. Our focus is on understanding the mechanics of internal network protocols, with a specialization in cross-protocol interoperation and network architecture.

### Expertise

- Network-layer protocols
- Cross-protocol interoperation
- Network architecture
- Decentralized peer-to-peer systems

## Current Focus

Over the last few years our team has been particularly active in the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) space. However, our work extends far beyond these domains. As of the beginning of 2024 we will be expanding our focus on the wider libp2p ecosystem and the projects and platforms that build on top of it. We will be diving deep into libp2p components and libp2p-based protocols as independent entities and we will investigate exogenous factors that influence their performance.

## Recent Major Projects
