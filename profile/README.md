# Welcome to ProbeLab ðŸ‘‹

The Protocol Benchmarking & Optimization Team

## About Us

[ProbeLab](https://probelab.io) is on a mission to measure the performance of Web3.0 network protocols, benchmark protocols against target performance milestones, and propose improvements to their core design principles. Our focus is on understanding the mechanics of internal network protocols, with a specialization in cross-protocol interoperation and network architecture.

### Expertise

- Network-layer protocols
- Cross-protocol interoperation
- Network architecture
- Decentralized peer-to-peer systems

## Current Focus

Our team is particularly active in the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) space. However, our work extends beyond these domains, as we dive deep into protocols as independent entities and investigate exogenous factors that influence their performance.

## Recent Major Projects
